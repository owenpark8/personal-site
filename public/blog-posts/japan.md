Went to Japan over this winter break. It was fun :)

A group of 9 of us went to visit our friend who lives in Tokyo. Some short notes:

-   Spent a little over a week in Tokyo
-   Spent a little under a week in Osaka
-   Kyoto was the best. Spend a lot of time in Kyoto.
-   Go to Enoshima for fire view of Mt. Fuji and sunset on beach right outside of Tokyo
-   よしふくis a fire lowkey Soba spot in Enoshima
-   Shibuya nightlife is fun
-   Tachihira is a fire lowkey ramen spot in Shibuya
-   Conbinis are the best part. Hot tea + spicy fried chicken cutlet + mochi ice cream = :D
-   Definitely coming back to Japan. Probably to ski and hit Korea again
