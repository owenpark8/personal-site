A snake walks into a bar. The bartender goes: "how the f**k did you just do that?" I just like that joke a lot, so I had to start my first blog post with it.

### Yapping about myself

Today is my birthday! I turned 20 today, so I guess the creation of this blog coincides pretty well with that. As of writing this, I currently have an internship at Magna International (automotive company) in Troy, MI as an embedded software engineer doing corporate R&D. I'll probably write a blog post at the end of it. I'm a computer engineering student at the University of Michigan and my current interests are in computer architecture, embedded systems, and system software. Web is cool I guess, but it feels more like a fun little hobby that I don't take too seriously.

Now, it is the summer after my second year of college and for the first time in a while, I have some free time and am not actively creating anything for future me. So, I was like, why not just make a blog? It's great for documenting and looking back on. It would also serve as a great side project to work on. So here I am... writing a blog... cool.

### What to expect

This will mostly serve as a place for me to write about my projects as a computer engineer. Details about my projects — personal, academic, and in my career — what I learned and what I would do differently. I'll try to keep the yapping to a minimum. I get told I sometimes ramble on in circles and I'm finding that it's true when I write, too. I am deleting *a lot* of what I write. Anyways, I at least want to write for long enough where I can look back at a substantial amount of stuff. Hopefully I keep this up throughout my lifetime. We'll see.
