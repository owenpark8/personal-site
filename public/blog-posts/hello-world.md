A snake walks into a bar. The bartender goes: "how the f**k did you just do that?" I just like that joke a lot so I had to start my first blog post with it.

So yea... a blog. I guess I'll start with why I made this.

## Yapping about myself

I can remember random facts, a lot of song lyrics, and things for classes, but I can't seem to hold on to memories of things I've done. That's why I used to really enjoy making YouTube videos before college. Whether it was a school project or a montage for a video game I was playing, it provided a snapshot of my life at the time that I could always look back on and have forever. Then, during a random grad party in the summer of senior year of high school (2022), I downloaded BeReal. I had a lot of fun documenting my life through a simple front/rear camera picture every day. I continued BeReal until around the start of my sophomore of college (2023) when I got kinda bored of BeReal. On top of this, during the winter semester (spring semester for non-UMich people) of that year, I knew I was going to be taking a difficult schedule. I was taking EECS 373, EECS 470, EECS 216, differential equations (at a local community college), and Korean. On top of the coursework, I was doing research with a professor and getting ready to become the embedded software lead for MRover [1]. So, going into the semester, I completely quit Twitter (another form of "blogging" for me where I posted random thoughts and jokes) along with every other social media and practiced a form of "ultra productivity," taking inspiration from ThePrimeagen.

Now, it is the summer after my second year of college and for the first time in a while, I have some free time and am not actively creating anything for future me. So, I was like, why not just make a blog? It's great for documenting and would also serve as a great side project to work on. So here I am... writing a blog... cool. I guess a little about myself:

Today is my birthday! I turned 20 today so I guess the creation of this blog coincides pretty well with that. As of writing this, I currently have an internship at Magna Internship in Troy, MI as an embedded software engineer. I'll probably write a blog post at the end of it. I'm a computer engineering student at the University of Michigan and my current interests are in computer architecture, embedded systems, and system software. Web is cool I guess, but it feels more like a fun little hobby that I don't take too seriously.

## What to expect

This will mostly serve as a place for me to write about my projects as a computer engineer. Details about my projects — personal, academic, and in my career — what I learned, and what I would do differently. I'll try to keep the yapping to a minimum. I get told I sometimes ramble on in circles and I'm finding that it's true when I write, too. I am deleting *a lot* of what I write. Anyways, I at least want to write for long enough where I can look back at a substantial amount of stuff. Hopefully I keep this up throughout my lifetime. We'll see.

### Notes
[1]: Just as a sidenote to anybody attending or planning to attend the University of Michigan: NEVER - and I mean NEVER - do what I did. I survived with all A's but it cost me my sanity. I had to pull my first all-nighter for the first time in my life (more on this probably in a EECS 373 project blog post).
